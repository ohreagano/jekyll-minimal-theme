- When Jekyll is running in one terminal, open another to make commits and type other commands. 
You can't type other commands on top of the jekyll application without shutting that down.

And why didn't that show up as a list? This is a .md file

#Reagan is learning to use Jekyll

Why is that not showing up as a header? Has that markdown style not been set up yet?
